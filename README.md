# Expo Snippet Showcase üëã

This [Expo](https://expo.dev) application serves as a showcase for small, reusable, and open-source code snippets. The goal is to provide a collection of practical solutions and technical demonstrations that are easily accessible.

## ‚ú® Features (Examples)

*   Simple navigation between different snippets.
*   Clearly displayed and explained source code.
*   Ability to easily copy code snippets.
*   (Add other project-specific features here)

## üöÄ Get Started

1.  Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  Start the app

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

    In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:

    *   A [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
    *   An [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
    *   An [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
    *   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo.

## üí° Code Snippets (Showcase)

This section is dedicated to presenting the code snippets. Each snippet should ideally have:

*   A descriptive name.
*   A brief description of its utility.
*   The source code itself.
*   Usage instructions or examples.

*(You can structure this section as you wish, for example, with links to specific folders or markdown files for each snippet).*

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We encourage the community to contribute by adding their own code snippets! To do so:

1.  Fork the project.
2.  Create a new branch for your snippet (`git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-snippet`).
3.  Add your code and ensure it is well-documented.
4.  Organize your snippet clearly (e.g., in a dedicated folder).
5.  Open a Pull Request with a detailed description of your addition.
